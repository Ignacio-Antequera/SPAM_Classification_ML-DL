# SMS Spam Classification using Advanced Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## Project Overview

Hi There! My name is Ignacio Antequera. This project aims to solve the SMS spam classification task by leveraging the power of Advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. By applying various models and tools, we build a robust system that can accurately classify incoming SMS messages as either spam or legitimate.

## Project Highlights

- Utilized Advanced ML & DL techniques for SMS spam classification.
- Employed a variety of classifiers and neural networks.
- Performed data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Built an end-to-end system for spam detection.

## Dataset

We used the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating our models.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training and testing.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gained insights into the dataset's distribution and features.
3. **Model Selection:** Chose a diverse set of classifiers and neural networks for comparison.
4. **Model Building:** Constructed ML and DL models for SMS spam classification.
5. **Training & Hyperparameter Tuning:** Trained models on the training set and fine-tuned hyperparameters.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using various metrics.
7. **Results Visualization:** Visualized evaluation metrics using plots and graphs.

## Model Building

Utilized a range of models, including:
- CountVectorizer with Naive Bayes classifiers
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- KNeighbors Classifier
- Support Vector Classification (SVC)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Bagging Classifier
- Embedding Layer with Bidirectional LSTM

## Evaluation

Models were evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of how well the models perform in distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the provided code blocks in your preferred Python environment.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of Advanced ML and DL techniques to the SMS spam classification task. By exploring various models, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics, we've built a comprehensive system for identifying spam messages.
